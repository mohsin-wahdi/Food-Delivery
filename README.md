üìö Project Overview
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a complete Food Ordering Website / App using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with Stripe for payment integration.

We will be building a full-featured application that includes:

A user-friendly Frontend Website

A secure and powerful Backend Server

A dedicated Admin Panel

User Authentication

Shopping Cart

Stripe Payment Integration

Order Status Tracking

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Features
1. Frontend Development (React.js)
Build a responsive UI for the food ordering system.

Create different pages: Home, Menu, Cart, Login, Signup, Orders.

Implement routing using React Router.

Connect frontend to backend APIs.

2. Backend Server (Node.js & Express.js)
Set up Express server.

Create RESTful APIs for authentication, food items, orders, and payments.

Handle secure communication between frontend and backend.

3. Database (MongoDB)
Design database schemas for users, products (food items), orders, and admin data.

Connect MongoDB to the backend using Mongoose.

Store and retrieve data securely.

4. User Authentication System
Allow users to register and login.

Use JWT tokens for session management and secure API access.

Protect routes to ensure only logged-in users can place orders.

5. Shopping Cart Functionality
Enable users to:

Add food items to the cart.

Increase/decrease item quantity.

Remove items from the cart.

Store cart state efficiently (either locally or in the database).

6. Stripe Payment Integration
Integrate Stripe for seamless and secure online payments.

Handle the checkout process and order confirmation.

Validate successful payments before placing an order.

7. Order Placement & Status Tracking
Allow users to place an order after payment.

Save order details in the database.

Implement an admin panel to:

View all orders.

Update order statuses (Pending, Preparing, Delivered, etc.).

Enable users to track the status of their orders in real-time.

‚úÖ Final Outcome
By the end of this project, you will have built a fully functional food ordering web app that supports:

User management

Real-time order system

Secure payments

Admin control panel

Clean and scalable MERN stack architecture
